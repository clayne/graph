# graph

Simple (directed) graph library.

__NOTE__: This library is currently incomplete. Just pushed it up to save the work. Feel free to test it, but please hold off any contributions for a moment, until I push the rest of the code, so we don't step on each other's toes.

## Usage.

__TODO__.

## TODO.

- Write some damn good documentation!
- Write some more damn good documentation!!!
- Fight a bear.
- Add support for adjacency matrices.

## Notes!

- Please, do not rely on the ABI yet ... things are changing, so the ABI will *likely* change a few times before it's somewhat stable. The API, however, while not guaranteed, will most likely only get better, without breaking backwards compatibility.
